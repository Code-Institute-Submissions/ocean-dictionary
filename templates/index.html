						<p class="section-paragraph"><br>The White Shark, more commonly referred to as the "Great White," has been reported to be involved in more attacks on humans than any other shark. It's thought that they attack humans when they mistake diver and surfer silhouettes
                            in the water during approaching from below the surface of the water. An alternative theory has also been suggested that Great Whites attack unfamiliar objects to test their potential as food. If true, that would help explain
                            their involvement over the years in myriad hit-and-run attacks near beaches.
