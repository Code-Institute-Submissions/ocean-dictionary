                            in the water during approaching from below the surface of the water. An alternative theory has also been suggested that Great Whites attack unfamiliar objects to test their potential as food. If true, that would help explain
                            their involvement over the years in myriad hit-and-run attacks near beaches. <br><b>CREDIT:<i> CBS Interactive Inc.(2019)</i></b>
